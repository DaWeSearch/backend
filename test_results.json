            "abstract": "The article covers one of the most pressing and discussed topics in business\u2014cryptocurrency. A narrow understanding of this category in our country and a cautious, rather negative even, attitude towards it is associated with a certain lack of understanding of the \u201cBlockchain\u201d technology in society as well as the lack of legal regulation by the legislator. The latter results in significant disagreement between the positions of state bodies regarding the technology. The relevance of the studied topic is that both the cryptocurrency itself and the legal basis for its functioning in Russia are in their infancy, however, its adoption and development can lead to significant economic benefits. At present, the need to develop the legal framework for the use of cryptocurrency and designate the further vector of the generation of the legislative framework aimed at legal regulation of this industry has become quite acute. In the article also the analysis of the emerging judicial practice of Russian arbitration courts and courts of general jurisdiction related to the recognition of cryptocurrency as an object of civil rights is carried out.",

            "abstract": "As the rising popularity of Bitcoin, people tend to use Bitcoin wallets to manage the keys for spending or receiving funds. Instead of generating randomly pairs of keys, which may need higher space complexity for key management, hierarchical deterministic\u00a0(HD) wallets derive all the keys from a single seed, which is sufficient to recover all the keys, to reduce the complexity of key management. In an HD wallet, it allows users to generate child public keys from the parent public keys without knowing any of the corresponding private keys. This feature allows a permitted auditor to derive all the public keys for auditing. However, this feature makes HD wallets suffered from so-called privilege escalation attacks, where the leakage of any child private key along with its parent public key will expose the other child private keys. To confront with this security flaw, we propose a novel HD wallet scheme that gives out a signature with trapdoor hash functions instead of directly giving private keys for signing. Since it conceals private keys from any child nodes, it can prevent from privilege escalation attacks. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme also provides unlinkability between two public keys to achieve anonymity of user identities and high scalability to the derivations of huge amount of keys. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves user anonymity, public key derivation, and high scalability.",

            "abstract": "Grover\u2019s algorithm confers on quantum computers a quadratic advantage over classical computers for searching in an arbitrary data set, a scenario that describes Bitcoin mining. It has previously been argued that the only side effect of quantum mining would be an increased difficulty. In this work, we argue that a crucial argument in the analysis of Bitcoin security breaks down when quantum mining is performed. Classically, a Bitcoin fork occurs rarely, i.e., when two miners find a block almost simultaneously, due to propagation time effects. The situation differs dramatically when quantum miners use Grover\u2019s algorithm, which repeatedly applies a procedure called a Grover iteration. The chances of finding a block grow quadratically with the number of Grover iterations applied. Crucially, a miner does not have to choose how many iterations to apply in advance. Suppose Alice receives Bob\u2019s new block. To maximize her revenue, she should stop and measure her state immediately in the hopes that her block (rather than Bob\u2019s) will become part of the longest chain. The strong correlation between the miners\u2019 actions and the fact that they all measure their states at the same time may lead to more forks\u2014which is known to be a security risk for Bitcoin. We propose a mechanism that, we conjecture, will prevent this form of quantum mining, thereby circumventing the high rate of forks.",

All transaction information in the Bitcoin system is published on the network and can be used to reveal the identity of the user by transaction correlation analysis. In this paper, a secure and privacy-preserving mix service for Bitcoin anonymity, Lockmix, is proposed. Lockmix introduces mix servers to provide a mix service for the user by using blind signature and multi-signature schemes to prevent attackers from linking the input address with the output address. Lockmix provides anonymity, scalability, accountability, Bitcoin compatibility and anti-theft. Lockmix has been implemented on a Bitcoin test network, and experiments show that our solution is efficient.",

            "abstract": "In the Bitcoin system, large numbers of miners invest massive computing resources in the blockchain mining process in pursuit of Bitcoin rewards, which are comprised of a fixed amount of system-generated new block reward and a variable amount of user-submitted transaction fees. Here, transaction fees serve as the important tuner for the Bitcoin system to define the priorities in users\u2019 transaction confirmation. In this paper, we aim to study the priority rule for queueing transactions based on their associated fees, and in turn users\u2019 strategies in formulating their fees in the transaction confirmation game. We first establish a full-information game-theoretical model to study users\u2019 equilibrium fee decisions; and then discuss three types of Nash equilibria, under which no, all and some users submit transaction fees. Moreover, we conduct empirical studies and design computational experiments to validate our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that (1) users\u2019 fee decisions will be significantly affected by their waiting time; (2) the reduced time costs, instead of transaction values, are the basis for users to evaluate their revenues; (3) longer waiting time and higher unit time cost drive users to submit transaction fees in pursuit of desired priorities; (4) with the required transaction fee increasing, the proportion of fee-submitting users decreases slowly at first followed by a sharp decline, and over-high required fees will make the transaction confirmation game end up with no users submitting fees.",

While the topic originated in computer science, the business and economics literature was comparatively slow to pick up on it. To better understand the academic basis, current developments and future research avenues of the discourse, 9672 cited references of 467 blockchain and cryptocurrency articles from the fields of business and economics are gathered from the Web of Science Core Collection and are analyzed. Five major strands of research are identified through factor analysis. They are reviewed and their interrelation is mapped using social network analysis. Research on (I) market efficiency and economics and (II) asset pricing and valuation is relatively mature and focuses on cryptocurrencies, while research on (III) the principles and applications of blockchain technology, (IV) transactions and anonymity and (V) monetary theory and policy lacks maturity. Potential paths for future research are pointed out and in conclusion, it is assessed that this young field of research still leaves plenty of room for manoeuvre. A scientific place next to Nakamoto (2008) is still available for existing, emerging and new research streams.",

The blockchain technology has been widely applied in the evidence storage scenarios to prove that an event occurred at a certain time due to its publicity and immutability. However, the timestamp of a block in the blockchain is introduced by the blockchain node and can be manipulated in hours. This will either lead the failure of the evidence storage system built on top of the blockchain platform or increase the risk of double spending of the blockchain platform itself. In this paper, we introduced an optimized blockchain timestamp mechanism. We narrow the range of the timestamp in a block to an average of ten minutes by leveraging an outside trust timestamp service to the blockchain consensus. Finally, we present a security analysis of the proposed scheme.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the adjustment process of the Bitcoin/dollar exchange rate towards its long-run equilibrium value in a nonlinear panel framework. A smooth transition error correction model is estimated to empirically validate the adjustment of the Bitcoin/dollar exchange rate in relation to its fundamental value. Results depict the presence of a nonlinear adjustment mechanism that reduces the Bitcoin/dollar rate to a partially stable long-term situation. Further, we find empirical evidence that the social media is an effective tool in today\u2019s Bitcoin/dollar exchange rate process.",

            "abstract": "Hacks are one of the most damaging types of cryptocurrency related crime, accounting for billions of dollars in stolen funds since 2009. Professional investigators at Chainalysis have traced these stolen funds from the initial breach on an exchange to off-ramps, i.e. services where criminals are able to convert the stolen funds into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. We analyzed six hack subnetworks of bitcoin transactions known to belong to two prominent hacking groups. We analyze each hack according to eight network features, both static and temporal, and successfully classify each hack to its respective hacking group through our newly proposed method. We find that the static features, such as node balance, in degree, and out degree are not as useful in classifying the hacks into hacking groups as temporal features related to how quickly the criminals cash out. We validate our operating hypothesis that the key distinction between the two hacking groups is the acceleration with which the funds exit through terminal nodes in the subnetworks.",

            "abstract": "The research seeks to contribute to Bitcoin pricing analysis based on the dynamics between variables of attractiveness and the value of the digital currency. Using the error correction model, the relationship between the price of the virtual currency, Bitcoin, and the number of Google searches that used the terms bitcoin , bitcoin crash and crisis between December 2012 and February 2018 is analyzed. The study also applied the same analysis to prices of Bitcoin denominated in different sovereign currencies traded during the same period. The Johansen (J Econ Dyn Control 12:231-254, 1988) test demonstrates that the price and number of searches on Google for the first two terms are cointegrated. This research indicates that there are strong short-term and long-term dynamics among attractiveness factors, suggesting that an increase in worldwide interest in Bitcoin is usually preceded by a price increase. In contrast, an increase in market mistrust over a collapse of the currency, as measured by the term bitcoin crash , is followed by a fall in price. Intense world economic crisis events appear to have a strong impact on interest in the virtual currency. This study demonstrates that during a worldwide crisis Bitcoin becomes an alternative investment, increasing its price. Based on it, bitcoin may be used as a safe haven by the financial market and its intrinsic characteristics might help the investors and governments to find new mechanisms to deal with monetary transactions.",

            "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies represented by Bitcoin have fully demonstrated their advantages and great potential in payment and monetary systems during the last decade. The mining pool, which is considered the source of Bitcoin, is the cornerstone of market stability. The surveillance of the mining pool can help regulators effectively assess the overall health of Bitcoin and issues. However, the anonymity of mining-pool miners and the difficulty of analyzing large numbers of transactions limit in-depth analysis. It is also a challenge to achieve intuitive and comprehensive monitoring of multi-source heterogeneous data. In this study, we present SuPoolVisor, an interactive visual analytics system that supports surveillance of the mining pool and de-anonymization by visual reasoning. SuPoolVisor is divided into pool level and address level. At the pool level, we use a sorted stream graph to illustrate the evolution of computing power of pools over time, and glyphs are designed in two other views to demonstrate the influence scope of the mining pool and the migration of pool members. At the address level, we use a force-directed graph and a massive sequence view to present the dynamic address network in the mining pool. Particularly, these two views, together with the Radviz view, support an iterative visual reasoning process for de-anonymization of pool members and provide interactions for cross-view analysis and identity marking. Effectiveness and usability of SuPoolVisor are demonstrated using three cases, in which we cooperate closely with experts in this field.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a new consensus algorithm, Proof of Usage (PoU), for the blockchain technology. This consensus is introduced for permissioned (or private) blockchains and is designed for a user-centric personal data market. This market is subject to specific regulations with which conventional blockchains fail to comply. Proof of Usage aims to promote a new paradigm dedicated to usage incentivization, valuation, and control of user data in various sectors, such as banking and insurance. Other consensuses such as Proof of Stake or historical Proof of Work do not encourage coin spending and usage (in fact, Proof of Stake promotes the opposite). However, the value of the currency mainly depends on its use. This paper first introduces a contextualization of blockchain technology and decentralized consensus models. The motivation is then discussed for a new model of personal data exchange in a decentralized but supervised environment. The PoU protocol and its process flow are defined in detail. Furthermore, the paper explores two different approaches regarding the reward mechanism and the incentive model. Finally, the paper focuses on security requirements and how PoU meets such requirements in a permissioned-based blockchain system.",

We explore the worldwide spread of infrastructure necessary to maintain and grow Bitcoin as a system (Bitcoin nodes) and infrastructure enabling the use of bitcoins for everyday economic transactions (Bitcoin merchants). Specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of Bitcoin infrastructure. We offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of Bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises. On the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for Bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services. Finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies\u2019 usefulness in engaging in illicit trade.",

After 2013, as liquidity increased, the Hurst exponent rose to approximately 0.5, improving market efficiency. For several periods, however, the Hurst exponent was found to be significantly less than 0.5, making the time series anti-persistent during those periods.

A mere observation of the price rise and a comparison with the common characteristics of a bubble provide anecdotal evidence for the bitcoin bubble. Based on price and volume data up to the end of November 2017, formal empirical evidence is presented by using procedures that do not require the estimation of a fundamental value for bitcoin. The empirical evidence shows that (i) the volume of trading can be explained predominantly in terms of price dynamics; (ii) trading in bitcoin is based exclusively on technical considerations pertaining to past price movements, particularly positive price changes; and (iii) the price of bitcoin is an explosive process. These findings are interpreted to imply a price bubble.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years Bitcoin price dynamics has been the subject of intense research. One of the main stream of investigation is the identification of relevant factors affecting its returns and volatility; empirical evidence suggests a positive association between returns and sentiment proxies about the Bitcoin network, such as Wikipedia inquiries, internet search intensity on the topic, trading volume in main exchanges or sentiment measures obtained via natural language processing algorithms applied on specialized forums comments or social media posts on the theme. In this paper we investigate the association of trading volume and internet search intensity with Bitcoin returns and volatility, complementing the outcomes in Fig\u00e1-Talamanca and Patacca (Decis Econ Fin ISSN: 1129-6569, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10203-019-00258-7 , 2019 ) and Urquhart (Econ Lett 166:40\u201344, ISSN: 0165-1765, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.02.017 , 2018 ): we find no direct relationship between the two market attention measures and returns while both the trading volume and the internet search intensity affect positively Bitcoin volatility. Conversely, an increase in Bitcoin returns does increase both trading volume and internet search intensity, evidencing an inverse relationship between returns and attention measures. As a byproduct, we also detect a positive association between trading volume and the internet search intensity and no reverse relationship. Since market attention, especially internet search volume, do increase around relevant events and corresponding news or announcements for the Bitcoin market, we also analyze whether and to which extent the above relationships change, after specific events are taken into account. Indeed, by applying two different approaches, we show that the relationships may change significantly.",

Cryptocurrencies are digital financial assets, for which ownership and transfers of ownership are guaranteed by a cryptographic decentralized technology. The rise of cryptocurrencies\u2019 value on the market and the growing popularity around the world open a number of challenges and concerns for business and industrial economics. Using the lenses of both neoclassical and behavioral theories, this introductory article discusses the main trends in the academic research related to cryptocurrencies and highlights the contributions of the selected works to the literature. A particular emphasis is on socio-economic, misconduct and sustainability issues. We posit that cryptocurrencies may perform some useful functions and add economic value, but there are reasons to favor the regulation of the market. While this would go against the original libertarian rationale behind cryptocurrencies, it appears a necessary step to improve social welfare.",

For this purpose, by adopting the social network analysis methodological approach, it considers the geographical network of Bitcoin transactions as a proxy to measure the national level of fintech development and compares it with a set of economic freedom indicators related to the top 70 world economies. The analysis revealed significant relationships between the performed network centrality measures and national levels of economic freedom. In particular, as confirmed by the implemented multilevel regression models, high levels of freedom to trade internationally combined with a restrained value of inflation and low administrative requirements can be considered as determining factors for fintech development. The study also showed a large number of Bitcoin transactions conducted in those countries characterized by fewer capital controls and restrictions, a result that feeds suspicions of illegal behavior, such as money laundering or terrorism financing, carried out through the use of cryptocurrencies. Findings of this research might be strategic for fintech entrepreneurship and policymakers interested in designing policies that aim to foster innovative sectors while ensuring the legality of financial flows.",

            "abstract": "Bitcoin, which was initially introduced by Nakamoto, is the most disruptive and impactive cryptocurrency. The core Bitcoin technology is the so-called blockchain protocol. In recent years, several studies have focused on rigorous analyses of the security of Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain protocol in an asynchronous network where network delay must be considered. Wei, Yuan, and Zheng investigated the effect of a long delay attack against Nakamoto\u2019s blockchain protocol. However, their proof only holds in the honest miner setting. In this study, we improve Wei, Yuan and Zheng\u2019s result using a stronger model where the adversary can perform long delay attacks and corrupt a certain fraction of the miners. We propose a method to analyze the converge event and demonstrate that the properties of chain growth, common prefix, and chain quality still hold with reasonable parameters in our stronger model.",

An adversary should not be able to discover the relation between bitcoin addresses and bitcoin users to ensure effective privacy. However, the relation among bitcoin transactions can be used to analyze the bitcoin privacy information, which seriously jeopardizes the bitcoin anonymity. Herein, we describe the vulnerabilities associated with the anonymity mechanism of bitcoin, including the relation among bitcoin addresses and the relation among bitcoin users. Further, we demonstrate that the existing methods do not guarantee the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the analysis results. We propose a heuristic clustering method to judge the relation among bitcoin addresses and employ the Louvain method to discover the relation among bitcoin users. Subsequently, we construct an address-associated database of historical transactions and implement real-time updates. Extensive experiments are used to demonstrate the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Specifically, the proposed scheme reveals the privacy vulnerability associated with the blockchain technology. We expect that our scheme can be applied to improve the blockchain technology.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the novel proof-of-work based consensus algorithm, bitcoin has been the most successful decentralized cryptocurrency so far. In bitcoin system, parties (miners) compete to create blocks by doing publicly verifiable proofs of sequential work (proof-of-work) and the probability that a party wins the competition is proportional to the amount of computational power that he has invested. Note that its security holds under honest majority assumption in terms of the amount of computational power. In this paper, we provide the formal analysis of bitcoin backbone protocol in the non-flat model. Precisely, we rethink and redefine the model of computing puzzles to capture the real-world protocol execution, where each party owns different amount of computational power and does sequential computations towards a puzzle independently. Fortunately, our work obtains the better results in analyzing the security of bitcoin backbone protocol, which can reflect the real-world protocol execution better, without any additional assumptions but the honest majority assumption. Finally, we show that a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of bitcoin backbone protocol in our model securely.",

            "abstract": "In the Bitcoin network, the simplified payment verification protocol (SPV) enables a lightweight device such as a mobile phone to participate in the bitcoin network without needed to download and store the whole Bitcoin blocks. A Bitcoin SPV node initiates and verifies transactions of the Bitcoin network through the Bitcoin wallet software which is deployed on a resource constrained device such as a mobile phone. Thus, the security of the wallet is critical for the SPV nodes as it may affect the security of user\u2019s cryptocurrencies. However, there are some concerns about the security flaws within the SPV nodes which could lead to significant economic losses. Most of these vulnerabilities can be resolved by employing a secure user authentication protocol. Over the years, researchers have engaged in designing a secure authentication protocol. However, most proposals have security flaws or performance issues. Recently, Park et al. proposed a two-party authenticated key exchange protocol for the mobile environment. They claimed that their protocol is not only secure against various attacks but also can be deployed efficiently. However, after a thorough security analysis, we find that the Park et al.\u2019s protocol is vulnerable to user forgery attack, smart card stolen attack and unable to provide user anonymity. To enhance security, we proposed an efficient and secure user authentication protocol for the SPV nodes in the mobile environment which can fulfill all the security requirements and has provable security. Additionally, we provide performance analysis which shows our proposed protocol is efficient for the SPV nodes in the Bitcoin network.",

Cryptocurrency allows users to safely and anonymously use the Internet to perform digital currency transfers and storage. In recent years, the Bitcoin network has attracted investors, businesses, and corporations while facilitating services and product deals. Moreover, Bitcoin has made itself the dominant source of decentralized cryptocurrency. While considerable research has been done concerning Bitcoin network analysis, limited research has been conducted on predicting the Bitcoin price. The purpose of this study is to predict the price of Bitcoin and changes therein using the grey system theory. The first order grey model (GM (1,1)) is used for this purpose. It uses a first-order differential equation to model the trend of time series. The results show that the GM (1,1) model predicts Bitcoin\u2019s price accurately and that one can earn a maximum profit confidence level of approximately 98% by choosing the appropriate time frame and by managing investment assets.",

For example, Bitcoin is the main payment method for ransomware attackers and retailers on the Darknet. It is therefore useful to understand the features of cryptocurrencies and their economic implications. In this research, we use bitcoin, Ether, and XRP, the three cryptocurrencies with the highest market values as of this writing, as well as Libra, which is forthcoming and topical, as examples to analyze their features. Specifically, we argue that these cryptocurrencies are fundamentally different due to differences in the following factors: the identity management of their ledger writers, their consensus algorithms, and their coin supply. We discuss how these factors determine cryptocurrency performance, including security, privacy, and financial influence. We also discuss potential research topics around these cryptocurrencies that are still open.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain has been used primarily in cryptocurrency applications like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These use cases show the staying power of blockchain technology and suggest additional uses such as smart contracting. We suggest these use cases, while producing knowledge, do not forecast the future of blockchain. Learning-by-doing reveals the evolution of blockchain as a sociotechnical system, suggesting that there is more to learn. Predicting how sociotechnical systems will evolve is difficult, but historical and lexical analyses suggest two areas for blockchain growth. One is provenance, authentication through recording of ownership or other control state, applicable to jewels, real property, art works, food stuffs, designer items, and anything else where genuineness is valued. The other is chain-of-custody, proving that duty of care has been faithfully executed regarding living beings (children, people in legal custody, research subjects, research animals, pets), or that inanimate things (evidence, data, representations such as photographs) have not been tampered with.",

            "abstract": "Generally, information is the fundamental driver of assets pricing volatility in the financial market. This information can enter into the market either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The financial literature shows that Bitcoin market volatility is symmetrically informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Additionally, the symmetricity of volatility has been revealed to be of greater sensitivity to its past values compared to the new shock of the market values. This study therefore applied the symmetric volatility structure of Bitcoin currency which can be measured through four input attributes such as open price (OP), high price (HP), low price (LP), and close price (CP) for predicting its price future trend. The study uses Rapid-Miner programme based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The optimal model employs a multilayer neural network (NN) along with an \u201coptimised operator\u201d with the ability to locate the optimal factor loading of the applied algorithm. The findings indicate that ANN is an effective and adequate model for correctly predicting Bitcoin market prices using symmetric volatility attributes with accuracy level of 92.15% against the actual price, whereas the low price attribute is found to be the major promoter for Bitcoin price trend with percentage of 63%. This is followed by close price, high price, and open price with percentages of 49%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. The findings of the study therefore would be a valuable and significant input for commercial purposes among the cryptocurrency market players. In other worlds, based on these outcomes investors will proactively predicate the Bitcoin price trend and make the right investment decision either to buy, hold, or sale to gain up normal market return. This is considered a pioneering study that predicates the Bitcoin price trend based on its symmetric volatility structure. As these replication findings demonstrate, the proposed model is highly promising and applicable in a real-time trading system for predicting Bitcoin price future trend and maximising investment profits in Cryptocurrency markets.",

Given the significant importance of the future of blockchain technology to a range of disciplines and the fragmented knowledge base with little cross-disciplinary integration to fields such as computer science and law, we begin by offering a nontechnical explanation of the basics of blockchain and its applications such as smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, tokens, and initial coin offerings. We systematically review 152 articles in the burgeoning academic literature on blockchain and its applications and synthesize the findings from five parallel lines of enquiry for scholars: computer science, economics, entrepreneurship, and law and governance. Finally, we outline a comprehensive research agenda for scholars of regulation policy and governance, entrepreneurship and sustainability, organization design and theory, and consumer behavior, highlighting promising phenomenon, methodologies, data, and theories.

The Bitcoin network also employs public key cryptography to prevent the disclosure of information related to participating users. Although the public key cryptography ensures the privacy and hides the true identity of users in the Bitcoin network, it has recently been abused for illegal activities that have tarnished the charm of this novel technology. Detecting the illegal transactions associated with illicit activities in Bitcoin is therefore imperative. This paper proposes a machine-learning based approach that classifies Bitcoin transactions as illegal or legal.

Under this circumstance, this paper provides a new Bitcoin address association scheme which makes address tracing possible in Bitcoin systems. The proposed scheme can be used to warn relevant institutions to study more secure encryption algorithms to protect users\u2019 privacy. Specifically, the important features of a Bitcoin address are extracted. After that, to reduce the computational complexity, we transform the clustering problem of addresses into a binary classification problem in which we integrate the features of two Bitcoin addresses. A novel two-level learner model is then built to analyze if the two Bitcoin addresses are belonging to the same user. Finally we cluster the addresses belonging to the same user accordingly. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other address association schemes, which use deep learning models or heuristics, and can achieve an increase by 6%\u201320% in precision and by 10% improvement in recall.",

The proposed algorithm aims to classify the cold wallets, hot wallets and user wallets in the Bitcoin exchanges, which are verified by off-chain information from the Internet. By analyzing the structures of different Bitcoin exchanges, we find that most Bitcoin exchanges exist weakness in managing the reasonable amounts of bitcoins kept in hot wallets. A large amount of Bitcoins stored in hot wallets can meet the users\u2019 withdrawal demands but may increase the risk of attack. However, a small amount of bitcoins in hot wallet may be inconvenient to frequently transfer for cold wallet. The problem then is modeled as a Bitcoin withdrawal prediction problem for hot wallets. We adopt traditional and classific supervised learning methods to solve the problems. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach provides reasonable prediction results. Furthermore, we simulate two processes to analyze our results. The first process shows that Facebook-prophet outperforms other methods if there is no transaction occurred from cold wallets to hot wallet. The second process shows that the more transactions from cold wallets to hot wallets, the smaller Bitcoins required for hot wallets. Overall, our work is valuable and useful for the Bitcoin exchanges\u2019 business.",

This study considers three cryptocurrencies namely bitcoin which has rank 1st in the cryptocurrency list, Ethereum which has attracted a lot of hype because of its additional features and applications and litecoin which comes in the category of altcoin and ranked 6th in the cryptocurrency table. Among the two objectives of this paper, the first objective is to study the degree of correlation between cryptocurrencies for each day. And the second objective is to accurately predict the price of bitcoin, and altcoins like ethereum and litecoin in USD with Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The price data is sourced from CoinMarketCap and Yahoo Finance and the average of the two has been considered. We have considered 4\u00a0years of cryptocurrency data to train our LSTM model. Over this timescale, noise can disturb the signal, so we have opted for daily prices.",

            "abstract": "Aiming at the storage problem of blockchain, a space storage optimization scheme based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is designed. The scheme mainly achieves the purpose of space optimization by summarizing the blocks regularly, excluding the expired Transaction Output (TXO) that has no effect on verification. The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) will be saved as a file on the IPFS network during optimization. In this way, the miner node can quickly get the file and start mining. The ultimate goal is to optimize the storage space for the node and to increase the synchronization efficiency of the newly added miner node. The simulation experiment of the proposed optimization scheme is carried out. The experimental results show that the scheme can summarize the historical transaction data regularly, eliminate the Spent Transaction Output (STXO) which has no effect on the verification transaction, so as to effectively reduce the node storage space.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to predict transactions that are likely to be included in the next block from the mempool of unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin network. To implement the proposed method, we applied machine learning to the transactions data collected from the Bitcoin network and divided our implementation into the following three objects: Data Collector; Data Preprocessor; and Analyzer. We used the random forest classifier algorithm because the problem of predicting the likelihood of a transaction to be included in the next block is a binary classification problem. We evaluated the performance of our model by comparing transactions in the mempool against transaction published in the next two blocks mined at the time of our experiments. For both blocks, our model has a prediction accuracy of more than 80% and a minimal false negative error. The analysis of transaction inclusion in the next block is fundamental as it could drive the price of Bitcoin or signify the properties of a given transaction such as illegal or legal.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing number of crypto-ransomware attacks that encrypt files and ask for money in exchange of decryption key causing huge loss of information and money to the affected organizations and users. A major reason for this increasing number of attacks is large financial gains with benefits of anonymity provided by crypto-currency like bitcoin. Traditional security solutions are incapable to detect such crypto-ransomware. This is mainly because they use signature-based detection methods, whereas crypto-ransomware keeps on evolving and use techniques like code obfuscation that can bypass these security solutions. This paper discusses the working mechanism of crypto-ransomware, limitations of signature-based detection methods and how behaviour-based detection method is an effective mechanism for the detection of crypto-ransomware. The paper investigates the distinctive behaviour of crypto-ransomware as compared to genuine applications. This behaviour analysis is further utilized to propose and validate a classification model to detect and classify ransomware from genuine applications.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of cryptocurrency, such as the Bitcoin, block chain technology, as the bottom technology of Bitcoin, has been widely concerned by researchers. Block chain has the characteristics of decentralization, anonymity and non-tampering, which realizes the transformation from social trust to machine trust. As an important part of block chain system, digital signature is relatively inefficient. For this reason, this paper proposes an aggregation signature scheme based on FPGA, which combines the aggregation signature technology with the reconfiguration of FPGA, realizes the aggregation of multiple user signatures into one signature, and has multiple ECC acceleration modules in FPGA. The efficiency of digital signature calculation is improved. Through experimental analysis and comparison, the scheme uses FPGA reconstruction and aggregate signature technology, which not only improves the computational efficiency of ECC, but also improves the efficiency of signature verification and improves the performance of block chain system.",

PBTs can make the channel network imbalanced, i.e., funds in a few channels become very low and funds in other channels become very high. Imbalanced channel network may make PBT infeasible. Hence we need a routing algorithm for PBT that keeps the channel network balanced. In existing solutions for this problem have privacy problem as the channels have to reveal their balances in order to find suitable routes for PBTs. In this paper, we mitigate this problem as we propose a flocking based algorithm for PBTs that keeps the channel network balanced.",

In this paper, a uniform payment system is designed with the following advantages. (1). By limiting the token-minting right to a designated token-minting bank and the design of label, our system prevents the counterfeit token problem. (2). A complete transaction is divided into Bitcoin-level part and Fabric-level part. The Bitcoin-level part constructs inputs and outputs and signs these inputs, outputs and a nonce with a private key. This makes a micro enterprises or an end consumer can enjoy the payment service as the Bitcoin-level operation can be implemented on a mobile phone. The double-spending problem is prevented by the Fabric-level mechanism. (3). The system is easy to expand. When there is a new payment application, only one sub-function is added to the payment contract to implement the payment application, and a call to the sub-function is added. (4). Compared with Bitcoin, the unlockcode of UTXO only needs to be stored once, instead of being stored with each UTXO, thus reducing the sizes of transactions. As an application, based on the uniform payment system, we design an application of cash-on-delivery without any trusted third party. It provides technology support for any two persons to trade without any trusted third party. Similar to the payment system, a system for asset confirmation, asset transfer and redemption is designed.",

            "abstract": "We consider time series analysis on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The traded values of any financial instrument could be seen as being influenced by market forces as well as underlying fundamentals relating to the performance of the asset. Bitcoin is somewhat different in this respect because there isn\u2019t an underlying asset upon which its value may depend on. Here, by constructing a simple linear time series model, and by attempting to explain the variation in the residual signal by means of macroeconomic and currency exchange variables, we illustrate that the influencing variables are vastly different for cryptocurrencies from a stock indices (S&P 500) in both timescales analysed (daily and monthly values). We use a sequential estimation scheme (Kalman filter) to estimate the autoregressive model and a sparsity inducing linear regression with lags (LagLasso) to select relevant subsets of influencing variables to compare.",
